A thing for GOAT.

What if we can give one person to give each amount from $1 to $200? Then we can (hopefully) raise $20,100 quickly and without a single person having to contribute more than $200


Wanna try for yourself?

1. Bundle Install

2. If you're using Postgres, you'll need a db named '200donors' or whatever you change your database file to (createdb 200donors)

3. Seed database (Database.seed_data)

4. Set your stripe keys (test or live)


Console:

```
irb
require './app.rb'
```

on Heroku
```
heroku run irb
require './app.rb'
```
